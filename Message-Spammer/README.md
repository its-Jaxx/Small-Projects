# Message Spammer
Very simple Python code that sends messages.

- You may change the words in the 'messages' dictionary at the top. You can always add more words.
- You may change the 'pui.write' message towards the bottom.
- When you're satisfied with what you want it to write, run the code, enter how many messages you want to send, what the delay should be, and let it run.
- Note that the delay may be longer due to weird delays caused by PyAutoGUI.

- A tkinter version is also available, as well as an exe file in the releases. These may be easier to use since there's no need to use the console.
